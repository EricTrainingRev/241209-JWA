    - conversely, describe anything your automated test suite missed that you discovered during manual testing
2. Run your Automated Tests

        - what new defects were discovered in your testing?
        - how did your understanding of the underlying causes of the defects discovered in your E2E testing change based on the testing done this sprint?
        - what parts of the Planetarium source code were the most difficult to test?
3. Perform Sprint retrospective

        - you were quick to implement your test strategy to streamline work
        - you came up with a way to automate much of the setup/tear down for resetting your test environment between tests
        - etc.
    - what can be improved for next Sprint?
        - did you underestimate how long a phase would take to complete?
        - did you do a poor job of implementing your chosen testing techniques?

## Recommendations
- visual aids are welcome but not necessary for this presentation
- make sure your team does a couple practice runs for your presentation
- write down what you are going to say for your part of the presentation
- create your test summaries the day before your presentation: if something goes wrong with the live demo you have the pre-made results to fall back on
    - if something goes wrong in the live demo don't spend much time trying to debug: move on if you can't fix it quickly
- all team members are expected to have their cameras on during the presentation: make sure you are somewhere distraction free
- remember to be proud of the work you have accomplished
