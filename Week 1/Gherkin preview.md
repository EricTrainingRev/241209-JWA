# Gherkin Preview
Gherkin will become more important when we start using Cucumber, but for now it provides some consistent language to help us understand what is happening in our Acceptance Criteria. There are some standard words used to describe the different kinds of actions/conditions a user can be involved with in Acceptance Criteria:
- Given: a "Given" statement is meant to indicate a starting condition. This is where your Acceptance criteria starts, and should provide the reader with any pre-requisite understanding of the background information necessary for the Acceptance Criteria to be able to be fulfilled
- When: a "When" statement is meant to indicate an action taken by the user trying to fulfill the User Story via the Acceptance Criteria
- And: an "And" statement is meant to continue whatever the previous step was doing: if you have a "Given" and "And" paired together you are simply indicating there is more than one starting condition to be aware of. If you match a "When" and "And" you are indicating that the actions being taken are meant to be seen as similar or you should mentally consider them as a group
- Then: a "Then" statement is meant to be used to indicate an ending condition for your Acceptance Criteria. These are the outcomes you are expecting that will indicate your User Story has be accomplished successfully, or in the case of Sad Path Testing, your system has responded to the user actions in way that is expected
