# Testing Terminology
- Manual Testing
    - testing performed manually by the tester without the use of automation software
- Automated Testing
    - testing performed by software that runs independent of a tester's manual input
- Test Case
    - test cases are the scenarios, test data, actors, and background information necessary for executing one or more tests
- Test Report
    - a summary of the results of test execution
- Acceptance Testing
    - is your application "acceptable"? Does it meet the requirements of stakeholders such as regulatory bodies (Regulatory Acceptance Testing), users (User Acceptance Testing)
- System Testing
    - testing your application as a whole works as intended
        - "End to End" testing is using an application like an end user would (or could) and validating the system/application behaves as expected across the board
- Test Plan
    - a comprehensive document that outlines how a system/application should be tested
- Test Object  
    - the goal you are trying to accomplish with your testing
- User Story
    - a universal description of a feature/requirement for an application
- Happy Path Testing (positive testing)
    - given valid input, the expected output is achieved in your test
        - valid input/data conforms to all requirements for an application/service
- Sad Path Testing (negative testing)
    - given invalid input, the expected output is achieved in your test
        - invalid input/data does not conform to one or more requirements for an application/service
- Test Suite
    - a collection of test cases that are connected in some way
- Standard Testing Life Cycle
    - an order of operations for organizing, building, executing, and reporting on test results
- Requirements Traceability Matrix
    - a document that provides a visual aid to help link user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria, test cases, results, and any other relevant resources together
- Acceptance Criteria
    - the steps involved to achieve a User Story
- Gherkin Syntax
    - standardized language that is used by the Cucumber testing software and in other documentation to provide universally understood information about a system/feature
- Equivalence Partitioning
    - a testing technique where one value is used to represent all possible values in a class
        - a class is data that follows one or more sets of requirements
