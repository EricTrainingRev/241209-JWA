# Agile Practices

## Daily Stand Up
- Stand Up should be performed once each day
    - give update on work completed in the previous day
    - give update on work to be completed today
    - describe any blockers and get assistance from teammates on how to resolve the blocker
- Stand Up should be documented and saved in your team Github Repo

## Pair Programming
- A "driver" write the code/performs debugging
- One or more "navigators" observe/comment on the driver's work to provide help and maintain familiarity with the code base
