# Presentation Requirements
- 15 minute presentation
- Visual Aids required
- all team members must participate in presentation
    - controlling presentation visuals is considered "participating"

## Visual Aid Recommendations
- Use your visual aids to emphasize your talking points: don't just read off the visuals
- PowerPoints are commonly used for final presentations, but other documentation such as test results, mvn site artifacts, agile documentation, test documentation, and other resources your team created may be used as well
- have your visuals ordered in such a way that it is a natural progression switching between them: this will help prevent the visuals presenter from becoming confused about what visual is next for the presentation

## Participation Recommendations
- having one team member present the visual aspects of the project can help reduce confusion and make the overall presentation smoother
- 15 minutes is not enough time to describe the work covered over three sprints in detail: since this is an SDET training your presentation focus should be on the testing work done
    - for those that have developed new features for your version of the planetarium: describe how you incorporated testing practices to help facilitate the development process for new features
- Live demos of your Unit, Integration, and System testing should be part of your presentation; while the tests are running you should still be giving your presentation
    - describe what is being tested
    - describe the kind of testing being done
    - describe the findings your team made, and for defects discovered, what the underlying causes were
    - describe how your initial testing informed your decisions about what stretch goals to focus on during this final sprint

## General Recommendations
- write down what you are going to say for your portion of the presentation
- do multiple practice presentations with your team to make sure your transitions are smooth and your presentation is as close to 15 minutes as you can make it
- take time to make your visual aids look professional
- ask questions before the presentation if you are uncertain about anything
