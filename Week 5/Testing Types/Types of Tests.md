# Types of Tests
- functional testing
- non-functional testing
- **Static Testing**
    - broad category of testing, it refers to testing/examining a program's code and/or documentation without running the app
        - linter or spell checker
        - check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
        - making sure source code follows company determined best practices
        - git strategies enforced
- **Dynamic Testing**
    - testing an application while it is running
- white box testing
- black box testing
- **Retesting**
    - testing done after fixing a defect to validate the fix was successful
        - Retesting is very easy to accomplish with Automated testing
- **Regression Testing**
    - testing done after a new feature is added to validate the fix did not break old functionality
        - Regression testing is very easy to accomplish with Automated testing
- **Smoke Test**
    - a test to validate that the resource being tested is actually in a state where it can be tested
        - think pinging a web application's "ready" route to check that the service is up and running
    - this kind of test falls under "Acceptance Testing"
    - "where there is smoke, there is fire"
    - akin to a general checkup with the doctor
- **Sanity Test**
    - A subset of regression testing: you want to test your new feature/fixed defect and make sure it works before running your regression tests
    - akin to going to a specialist
- **Alpha & Beta testing**
    - Alpha Testing: initial round of Acceptance testing, usually User Acceptance Testing, done by internal team members
    - Beta Testing: secondary round of Acceptance testing where the application is released to a select group of end users for testing
